                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">No Investment Advice</h2>
                <p>Hedge Fund Secrets provides financial education and consulting services for informational and educational purposes only. The content on this website, in our courses, and during our consultations is not, and should not be construed as, investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice.</p>
                <p>You should not make any decision, financial, investment, trading or otherwise, based on any of the information presented by Hedge Fund Secrets without undertaking independent due diligence and consultation with a professional broker or financial advisory.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Accuracy of Information</h2>
                <p>The information provided is on an "as-is" basis. We make no representations as to the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this site and will not be liable for any errors, omissions, or delays in this information or any losses, injuries, or damages arising from its display or use.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Risk of Trading</h2>
                <p>Trading in financial markets, including options and futures, involves a substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in trading can work against you as well as for you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.</p>
                <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on this website or in any of our materials.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">No Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
                <p>Your use of our services or consumption of our content does not create a fiduciary relationship between you and Hedge Fund Secrets or its founder, Matthias Bouquet. We are an educational resource, not your financial advisor or fiduciary.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Personal Responsibility</h2>
                <p>You are solely responsible for your own trading and investment decisions. By using our services, you agree not to hold Hedge Fund Secrets or any of its affiliates liable for any decisions you make based on the educational material we provide.</p>
