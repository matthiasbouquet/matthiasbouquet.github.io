                    <p>Most trading educators have never worked at a professional trading desk. With 8 years at JP Morgan, I bring actual institutional knowledge that's been battle-tested in real markets. We focus on risk-adjusted returns rather than get-rich-quick schemes, teaching strategies that hedge funds actually use to generate consistent profits.</p>

                    <p>Our strategies are designed for busy professionals. The initial learning phase might require 5-10 hours per week, but once you're up to speed, most members spend just 1-2 hours per week managing their trades. We provide clear checklists and systems to make the process efficient.</p>

                    <p>While options trading can be done with smaller accounts, we recommend at least $5,000 to properly implement our risk management rules and trade the strategies effectively. That said, we provide guidance on position sizing for various account sizes.</p>

                    <p>While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, our members have achieved excellent risk-adjusted returns. The key is consistency and proper risk management - we aim for steady gains rather than home runs. Our focus is on high-probability trades that work in various market conditions.</p>
