                <p>Last updated: July 22, 2024</p>

                <p>Our goal is to provide you with the highest quality financial education and consulting. Our refund policy is designed to give you peace of mind while ensuring that you are committed to the learning process. This policy applies to our "Options Trading Mastery" coaching program.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Eligibility for a Refund</h2>
                <p>We offer a conditional refund on our coaching program. To be eligible for a refund, you must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must request the refund <strong>after 60 days</strong> of starting the program, but no later than 75 days after starting.</li>
                    <li>You must demonstrate that you have made a good-faith effort to apply the course material.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">What Constitutes a "Good-Faith Effort"?</h2>
                <p>A good-faith effort is demonstrated by providing clear evidence that you have diligently studied the material and attempted to implement our trading principles. To qualify, you must submit the following documentation with your refund request:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Completion of Course Material:</strong> Proof that you have completed all video modules and assignments in the program.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attendance at Coaching Calls:</strong> Evidence of attending at least 75% of the live coaching calls or watching the replays for the first 60 days of your program.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade Journal:</strong> A detailed trading journal covering the 60-day period. This journal must include a minimum of 20 trades planned and executed according to the principles and strategies taught in the course. Each entry should detail the thesis, entry/exit points, risk management, and a review of the outcome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Written Summary:</strong> A short summary explaining why you believe the program was not a good fit for you, despite your efforts.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Why We Have This Policy</h2>
                <p>Trading success is a result of consistent effort, discipline, and proper education. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme. This policy exists to ensure that students are committed to their own success. We are confident that any student who genuinely engages with our material and puts in the work will see the value in our program. This refund is for those who, after making a sincere effort, find that our system does not work for them.</p>
                <p><strong>This refund is based on your effort, not your trading performance.</strong> We do not guarantee profits, and trading losses are not grounds for a refund.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">How to Request a Refund</h2>
                <p>To request a refund, please email us with the subject line "Refund Request" and include all the documentation listed above. We will review your submission and respond within 7-10 business days.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-dark mt-8 mb-4">Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about our Refund Policy, please contact us before purchasing the program.</p>
